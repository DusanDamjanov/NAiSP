CLI engine for storing big data implementation in Go.
Implementation involves write-path, delete-path and read-path. Engine has implemented strategies that make it crash proof, DoS proof (token bucket structure and algorithm). Also contains caching strategy.
Engine has ability to as quickly as possible search for specific data in big data set, update specific data, add and delete specific data from dataset.
Implemeted for class Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures.
